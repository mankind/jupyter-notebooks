            "Online education is becoming a mainstay of higher education. As schools and universities become more flexible and embrace online education, we must ensure that students have the opportunity to access quality education that is relevant to their needs and interests. This essay will discuss how we can structure online education around apprenticeship models and communities of practice, and how this will improve the quality of the learning experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "As an example, I will use the example of a new online course I am currently developing for my masters degree as a basis for the discussion. I currently have an online course developed, but have not yet finalized it. I have used a few ideas from other online learning courses to structure the course, and I have written a syllabus for it. I have also started to develop a community around the course. I have started with a course-wide community and have now decided to add the possibility of a community of practice, to make the course more personalised and relevant to the needs of my students. I am keen to develop a community of practice around the course, but understand that there will be students from all over Australia who will not be able to attend the course as part of their degree. Therefore, I am considering ways to structure the course so that it is suitable for students from throughout Australia, but I am also considering ways to support students from other countries (for example, students from China).\n",

Students will also be able to develop their skills through working within the course, and will be able to learn from other students and other members of their community.

I think leonardo's view comes from the same line of thought, but I disagree with his generalizations.\n",
            "There are different ways you can reason by analogy.\n",

For example, if you have a bad idea, don't just try to reason it out, but instead go to the hawk to catch it. He explains that this will help ensure that we do not get stuck with the wrong ideas.\n",
            "Leo's other argument is that it is important to reason by first principles instead of analogy. He argues that we should reason by principles instead of analogies. An analogy is an analogy. Now leonardo is right about the need to understand principles, but he is wrong about the need to understand analogy.\n",
            "Analogy is an analogy between two models, where one model is a concrete and real world model and the other is an abstraction model. In this case a hawk and a cat are concrete models. For example, the hawk and the cat are both in a cage. However, their abstract model is in the same room, in a cage.\n",
            "First principles are abstract and concrete. This is a difference between being first principles and being first principles. First principles are abstract and first principles are concrete. While first principles are abstract, they are first principles in the sense that they are principles that can help us reach our goal. First principles are also more concrete than first principles. There are also a lot of other reasons that first principles are more concrete than first principles.\n",
            "\n",
            "A:\n",
            "\n",
            "You seem to be conflating abstraction and analogy.  Analogy to a particular instance is different than an abstraction for a set of abstract principles.  For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "Suppose I want to make a decision between two choices. One is a rule I can use to determine which is the better choice. The other is a rule that's applied to the real world.\n",
            "I want to figure out which is best by first principles.\n",
            "Given two choices, we can derive a third choice using rule one, or a fourth if we've already decided on the second and third. \n",
            "First principles are abstract and the rules we use to make decisions about things like what to do with the fish in a tank are also abstract.  But the fact they make these decisions at all is the fact that they are first principles.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of these things being said, it may be helpful to think about analogy as in the example above as the use of a particular instance of abstraction.  It's not the use of the abstraction.  It's the use of abstraction in a particular way.\n",
            "But in that case the analogy is not between what the rules are and what the real world is, but between what the rules are and what the abstract principles are.  And that analogy will not be a true one.  (There's a whole chapter in the introduction to the Logic text of a mathematical logic text called \"Analogy and First Principles\" that goes into the difference between similarity and analogy.)\n",
            "In fact, the actual distinction between first principles and analogy is rather irrelevant in real-world situations.  The most common example of this is the difference between applying laws to the real world, and applying these laws to some specific things in the real world. \n",
            "I know a case from real life where a man decided to go to the store and buy a specific bottle of wine.  The store had this specific type of bottle, and the law gave it to him.  After trying three other wines, he decided he wanted the specific type of bottle.  The laws didn't give him this specific type of bottle--in fact, in this specific case, the laws didn't even apply to his choice.\n",
            "In the case above, the law says it's okay for him to buy the specific bottle of wine.  You can say that this is a first principle, and that's true.  That's why it's true.\n",
            "And then the second law says \"you can't get away with this if you have the specific type of bottle\".  In this specific case, the law doesn't really apply at all.  In general, as long as a law doesn't apply at all, it's a first principle.\n",
            "Likewise, the rules about what to do with a fish tank are rules about fish.  I could apply those rules to the real world, and then apply these to a particular fish.  And because it's a first principle, the rule is applied in the real world.  (In this specific case, it's not applied to a specific fish--in general, the rule applies to all fish.)\n",
            "So first principles and laws are different ways of saying the same thing.  They are like two different ways of saying the same thing.  They're like two different ways of doing the same thing.  Even if the laws were the same, and these rules were the same, it wouldn't make it true that they were a first principle.  They're different ways of doing different things.\n",
            "And again, the difference between laws and first principles is rather irrelevant in real-world situations, which are based on our actions.  In the real world, the laws and first principles are both important, but they are not necessarily the same.  Laws are true, but only for a narrow set of situations.  First principles are true for all situations.  And this is because the truth of a first principle is not based on how the situation is or how the situation is going to be.\n",
